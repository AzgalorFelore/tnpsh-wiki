# File Managers

## These pages will provide you with file managers you can install on your system. You should have at least one, but features vary in each so make sure you choose the right one for your conditions and use cases!

multiMAN and mmCM have a built-in app for file management, which can be accessed by switching to the XMMB layout and selecting "File Manager". webMAN MOD has a built-in FTP server, which can be accessed by a computer or phone with an FTP client. See the respective pages to learn more, if you wish to use these homebrew instead.
