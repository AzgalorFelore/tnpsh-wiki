# All-In-One

All in ones provide many features, such as backup creation, file management, game launching, and system tweaks, all with only one application. The main two are **multiMAN** and **webMAN MOD**, both offering different styles of interacting but essentially being the same (although each has its own quirks).

**Having at least one all-in-one is highly recommended for all of the users with homebrew on their system,** especially if you're planning on doing more than just running backups.

Below is the all-in-one I recommend and use regularly, however, you can always choose your own!

Recommended by Doregon: **webMAN MOD**
