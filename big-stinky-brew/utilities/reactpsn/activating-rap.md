# Activating .rap games

So, you've just installed a new game from your USB and are so excited to start playing it... you click its icon and--oh...

"This content can only be used if you renew the license in PlayStation Store."

Ahh, at one point, we've all had it happen. Even with installing the game alongside a .rap file, sometimes it just happens out of the blue. However, eActPSN can help fix this problem for you! Let's get started.

1. **You need to have reActPSN and the game you wish to activate.** reActPSN doesn't need .rap files to do its job.

2. **Create a new user** called "aa" (without the qoutes). This is the user reActPSN will use to tie licenses to.

3. **Launch reActPSN.** That's it. Once you return to the XMB, the aa user should be renamed to "reActPSN" with a bunch of gibberish afterwards, and that's how you'll know it worked! You can also check by pressing the triangle button on the game and selecting "Information", and then scrolling down to the Owner section.

**Sometimes, reActPSN doesn't work as well on HEN.** I've found that holding down SELECT helps every time, even though that button is not mapped in reActPSN.
