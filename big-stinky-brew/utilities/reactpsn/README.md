# ReActPSN

ReActPSN is a piece of homebrew that lets you do the following tasks:

* (Re)activate PSN games that ask for you to go to the PlayStation Store to play
* Converts PS2 ISOs into PS2 Classics format
* Converts PS3 ISOs into PSN games format (using BDloader)
* Delete user trophies
* Downgrade backups from >4.20 to 4.20 for more compatibility
* Load/unload backups (using BDloader, BDselector)

**Not all of the features available on ReActPSN work on HEN.** Testing is being done to see the limits of ReActPSN + HEN, so stay up to date to learn more.
