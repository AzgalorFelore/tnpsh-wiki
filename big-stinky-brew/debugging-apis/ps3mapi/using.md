# Using MAPI via Browser

If you have Rebug firmware or webMAN-MOD installed, you can use MAPI with any device on your network by browsing to: [your.ps3s.ip.here/home.ps3mapi](https://www.reddit.com/r/ps3homebrew/wiki/mapi)

webMAN also has a sidebar and you can select "PS3MAPI" when on the integrated web server.
