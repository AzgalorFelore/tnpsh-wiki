# Installing CCAPI on your PC

In order for your console and PC to be able to communicate between each other you also need to install the CCAPI software onto your PC. A download for the PC software can be found on the [CCAPI Installer page](](http://store.brewology.com/ahomebrew.php?brewid=254).

1. Extract the CCApi_package_2.80 folder on your desktop and open the folder named "PC" inside of it. You will find an installer named CCAPI-setupv2.80. 

2. Run the installer, and configure it as you please, or accept default settings.

3. After the install is complete, launch ControlConsole API and ensure that it launches properly.

# Connecting your Console (PC)

The final step to setting up the link between your computer and your console is adding your console to Console Manager. This program will save your console's information for you to use at a later time.

1. Launch ControlConsole API on your PC

2. Select the File tab on the top left and "Add new console". A dialog box will appear and ask for you to enter in the console name and IP address.

3. On the XMB navigate to Settings -> Network Settings -> Settings and Connection Status List. Locate where it says IP Address and write it down.

4. Enter a name for your console, and the IP address from Step 3, and press OK to save the settings.

5. You will now see your console's name and IP address listed in the Consoles window. Right click on it and select the Connect option. If it connected to your console, a dialog box will pop up stating that it has successfully connected to your console.

6. Click the Refresh button under the Console info category to verify that it can fetch information from your console.
