# Installing CCAPI on the Console

1. Install the [CCAPI Installer](http://store.brewology.com/ahomebrew.php?brewid=254) pkg on your PS3 and launch it.

2. Confirm the installation twice and allow the console to reboot. If successful, it should display a notification that CCAPI has been installed.

# Installing CCAPI on your PC

In order for your console and PC to be able to communicate between each other you also need to install the CCAPI software onto your PC. A download for the PC software can be found on the [CCAPI Installer page](](http://store.brewology.com/ahomebrew.php?brewid=254).

1. Extract the CCApi_package_2.80 folder on your desktop and open the folder named "PC" inside of it. You will find an installer named CCAPI-setupv2.80. 

2. Run the installer, and configure it as you please, or accept default settings.

3. After the install is complete, launch ControlConsole API and ensure that it launches properly.
