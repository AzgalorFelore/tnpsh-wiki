# CID Stealer Protection


If you are planning on using a mod tool on your PC in conjunction with CCAPI or TMAPI, it's a good idea to block the program's Internet access so it can't steal your ConsoleID (CID) and upload it to someone else if it is malicious. You can do this with the following process on Windows:

1. Click on your Start Menu and type "Windows Firewall" and select the option that pops up.

2. Select Advanced Settings → Outbound Rules (left side) → New Rule (right side).

3. Follow the wizard and select the .exe file of your mod tool and block it from Domain, Public, and Private networks.
