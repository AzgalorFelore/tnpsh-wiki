# Firmware Flashers

**This method is very dangerous, and can result in a brick as you are directly 
modifying your system's flash memory. If you're okay with the risks, have done this 
before, or don't really care if you brick your PlayStation 3, go ahead and follow 
these steps. I'd recommend using the ps3xploit or bguerville pages if you wish to 
prepare for CFW.**
