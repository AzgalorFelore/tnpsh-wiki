# bguerville toolset

The bguerville toolset provides useful functionality to get information about your console and, more importantly, help you patch your console without factory service mode or a firmware flasher. This option is safer than the ps3xploit default option because of how bguervilleâ€™s toolset can verify whether or not the system is downgradable and prevents you from doing anything without proper initialization of this process.

The bguerville toolset is fairly easy to use and provides tools to patch your firmware and peek/poke your memory at will. It also shows information about your console and can make informed decisions based on that--such as disabling certain features if you have a minimum downgrade praxis of 3.56 or higher, or not letting you use any of the features if you aren't on a PlayStation in the first place. The bguerville toolset is based off of "ps3xploit version 4.0", which was a new exploit found and mastered by bguerville and adapted for this purpose with the toolset.

## Patching your flash

The process of patching your flash to get ready for CFW is easy--you just have to know what to do from here. You'll also need to have a CFW compatible PlayStation, this won't work for non-CFW models.
