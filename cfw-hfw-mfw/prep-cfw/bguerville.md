# bguerville toolset

The bguerville toolset provides useful functionality to get information about your console and, more importantly, help you patch your console without factory service mode or a firmware flasher. This option is safer than the ps3xploit default option because of how bguervilleâ€™s toolset can verify whether or not the system is downgradable and prevents you from doing anything without proper initialization of this process.
